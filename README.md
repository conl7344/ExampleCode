# ExampleCode
Final project for an upper level electrical engineering signals and systems class.
This was a final project for a Python oriented lab. The code will take the values in the attached CSV file create noise and 
then the rest of code is analizing the signal using Fast Fourier Transforms and a programatic bandpass filter. The analysis technique
is done using bode plots and stem plots for magnitudes and phase distinction.

The attached figures are what should show when the code is ran. This project recieved a 100%
